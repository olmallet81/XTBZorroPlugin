# XTBZorroPlugin

## Introduction
XTB is a low-commission broker offering a wide range of tradables instruments. For opening a demo account go to: https://www.xtb.com/en/demo-account.

XTB offers free access to their API. The connection is made through TCP sockets. Link to API their documentation: http://developers.xstore.pro/documentation/#introduction.

This plugin allows to connect to their API from Zorro. It was written in Win32 C++ under Visual Studio 2017.

## Build Instructions
All dependencies have been fully integrated into the folder:

- RapidJson (for JSON parsing and writing)
- OpenSSL (for secure socket connection)

An old version of OpenSSL has been used to match the existing binary files within Zorro and required by this library: libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll.

This project includes a Visual Studio 2017 solution. You should be able to simply download the entire folder, open the solution, and build it, using the Release x86 build configuration.

## Installation Instructions
To install the plugin, simply place the binary file XTB.dll in the Plugin folder where Zorro is installed.

#### <ins>Streaming</ins>
All streaming services (tick prices, balance and trades) run on another thread.

#### <ins>Log</ins>
A log file is automatically generated at each connection to XTB and dumped into the folder C:\Zorro\Log\XTB by default. To adjust this path to your own Zorro folder path, please modify the line 63 in the header file XTB.h.

## Known Issues
Limit/Stop orders to reduce or close a trade cannot be deleted if their size is greater than 50% of the trade size.
Hence, this plugin has been implemented to cap limit/stop orders to 50% of the opened trade current position otherwise the plugin would not be able to close a trade with such an order attached.
